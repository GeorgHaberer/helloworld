## Hello world example

This is just a **toy example** for my first steps in github :)

I am really checking out here some formatting options, the following does __not__ make any sense
despite teaching me markup on github!

Wow a hidden table:
<details>
<summary>My top languages</summary>

| Rank | Languages |
|-----:|-----------|
|     1| **Python**|
|     2| Python|
|     3| R         |
|     4| C/C++     |

</details>

and here's a list ...

1. read
   - as much as you need
   - make a summary
   - get consensus and contradictions
2. think
3. hypothesis
4. get data
5. start coding
6. check results -> return to start

---
that's enough for today
